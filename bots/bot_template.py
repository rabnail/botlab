def get_buy_or_sell_signal(data):
    """
    Main algorithm method (the actual bot!), which will be called every tick. 
    This method receives a Pandas DataFrame(data). Each row of this Dataframe is a candle. 
    Rows of a DataFrame are dictionary like objects. To access a row value you can use 
    the follwing syntax: row_name['column_name']. Based upon this DataFrame the bot must 
    make a decision to buy, sell or do nothing. See below for a simple example.

    Param data: 
    List of candles or ticker data in the form of a Pandas Dataframe. The test environment
    uses candles (historical data) and the live environment ticker data. Candles or ticker data 
    have minimal the following properties: date, open, high, low, close and volume.

    Example candle /Â ticker data:
    date                open       high       low        close       volume      date
